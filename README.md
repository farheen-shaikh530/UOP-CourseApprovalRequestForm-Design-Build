## Overview
The **Study Abroad Dashboard** provides a unified, interactive view of:
- participation by **term** (Fall, Spring, Summer, Faculty-Led),
- **gender** and **ethnicity** distribution,
- **majors** and **schools** sending students,
- **top countries** and destinations over time.

The dashboards were used in presentations to the **Dean of Global Admission** and multiple **school deans** to guide strategic outreach and program planning.

---

## Problem
Prior to this work, the Study Abroad office lacked:
- Centralized, presentation-ready reporting,
- Disaggregated insights by **gender, ethnicity, majors, and schools**,
- Clear, consistent visual hierarchy for leadership storytelling.

---

## Users & Customer Needs
**Primary users:** Study Abroad coordinators, deans, advisors.  
**Key needs:** quick trend scanning, trustworthy metrics, exportable visuals, and accessible presentation view for decision meetings.

---

## My Role
- **UX Designer & Data Visualization Engineer**  
- Researched user needs, designed wireframes, and built final dashboards.  
- Implemented visualizations in Tableau and embedded them via React.  
- **Trained supervisors and coordinators** on how to:  
  - Update the data source in the dashboard,  
  - Access and share published dashboard links,  
  - Use interactive filters to view data by **term** and **academic year**.  
- Delivered documentation and live demos to ensure the dashboards could be sustained and updated after my internship.  
- Worked in Agile sprints with weekly cross-team feedback from Study Abroad, Media & Design, and student testers.

## Design Process
1. **Research & Discovery** – stakeholder interviews; data audit.  
2. **Ideation & Early Iterations** – low-fi chart sketches and Figma layouts; tested hierarchy/labels.  
3. **Implementation** – Tableau dashboards + React embeds; performance passes on large category sets.  
4. **Validation & Delivery** – usability checks with staff/students; shipped presentation deck for deans.

> **Brand Compliance:** Followed the official **University of the Pacific Brand Guidelines** for typography, spacing, color, and layout rhythm.
